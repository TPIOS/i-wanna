      <h1>Map file format</h1>
      In versions 1.2.0 and later, there is an extra copy of the data in map files that is much easier to write a parser for if you want to read jtool maps. Initially, making the map file format easy to parse didn't even cross my mind; I just compressed it for fun. I only realized my mistake when I had to make an additional parser myself.

      Anyways, now it's easy enough to parse that it should be self-explanatory. And for old jtool maps, you can just open and re-save them to get that extra copy of the data.
      <br><br>
      For reference, Jtool only reads the top copy of the data when opening files, and it probably always will, for backwards compatibility.
