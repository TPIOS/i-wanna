      <h1>Jtool</h1>
      jtool aims to be a feature-rich tool for designing and testing intricate needle platforming. I made it because RMJ (I Wanna Record My Jumps) is such an invaluable tool to the fangame community, yet it lacked a lot of features and was a bit quirky in my eyes. Oh, and also because I happened to have the motivation and time to do it.

      Jtool is made by me, Patrickgh3. Please contact me with bug reports (be descriptive), feature ideas, general feedback, and love notes. I'm on Skype often as "patrickgh3", and I stream sometimes on my <a href="http://www.twitch.tv/patrickgh3" target="_blank">Twitch channel</a>. I'm also on <a href="https://github.com/patrickgh3" target="_blank">Github</a> and maybe <a href="https://twitter.com/clockworkpat" target="_blank">Twitter</a> if you're into those sort of things.

      Special thanks to: YoYoYoDude1 for his GMStudio engine, TheNewGeezer for the original RMJ, and everyone who gave feedback, feature ideas, and encouragement; you know who you are.
