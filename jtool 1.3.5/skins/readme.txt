To submit new Jtool skins send an email to jtoolskins@gmail.com with a zip file of your new skins attached.
It would be helpful if you put "Jtool skins" as subject of the email.
Emails without an attachment will be filtered out.
Already existing skins won't be automatically replaced.

The plan is to update this skin folder every two months or so.
The skin repository link will stay the same through time.
You can download the newest pack of skin at http://www.mediafire.com/file/pxfdw3ddr4vaumd

If you think we're doing a terrible job at updating this folder regularly or you came up with a much better system to navigate through skins let us know!
We will update the delfruit link whenever someone comes up with a better idea than what we're currently doing.
