“User Agreement”: means this document and any documents that form part of it or are related to it, as updated from time to time.

“YoYo Games”: that’s us. We are YoYo Games Limited (company number 05260718) of Fourth Floor, 61 Southwark Street, London, SE1 0HL, UK (also “we” “us” and “our”).

“YYG Platforms”: means any YoYo Games platforms, products or services from time to time including (but not limited to) GameMaker Studio 2, GameMaker: Studio, GameMaker: Marketplace and YoYo Games websites (including the YoYo Games GameMaker Community / forums), as updated, replaced or expanded from time to time.

1. ACCEPTING THIS USER AGREEMENT
1.1. Acceptance of User Agreement. This User Agreement is a legally binding contract between Customers (that’s you) and YoYo Games (that’s us) regarding your use of the YYG Platforms and Publisher Property accessed via them, including but not limited to your use of GameMaker, licensing of software products or services via the GameMaker: Player or GameMaker: Marketplace. Please review it carefully. You are welcome to contact us at https://help.yoyogames.com if you have any questions or comments about this User Agreement, but in any event your continuing usage of YYG Platforms will demonstrate your approval of this User Agreement.
1.2. Access for Adults Only or With Adult Approval. In accepting this User Agreement and using the YYG Platforms, you represent and warrant that you have reached the age of majority in your country of residence, or where you are under the age of majority, that you have informed your parent or legal guardian to provide approval of your use of the YYG Platforms. You acknowledge that in such case, your use of the YYG Platforms is subject to your parent or legal guardian executing the relevant Consent Form. YYG is collecting information from Customers under the age of majority (as prescribed by applicable laws of each jurisdiction), including children under the age of 13 (collectively, “**Minors**”). If you are a parent or a guardian of a Minor, you must accept a separate Consent Form for the use of the Services by your Minor. For further information, please refer to our Privacy Policy.
1.3. Consent to Electronic Communications. By using the YYG Platforms, you consent to receiving certain electronic communications from us as further described in the Privacy Policy. Please read the Privacy Policy to learn more about your choices regarding our electronic communications practices. You agree that any notices, agreements, disclosures or other communications that we send to you electronically will satisfy any legal communication requirements, including that such communications be in writing.
2. PRE-RELEASE ACCESS
2.1. We may make any YYG Platform (or parts of it) available as a pre-release/alpha/beta version(s) from time to time. This means that it would be released with some or most of its features, but it would not be complete and would still be subject to testing/further development – therefore it may still contain bugs or errors. It is likely to therefore need patching and updating too. The pre-release period will last until we decide to end it. We do not make any promises about (or accept any liability for): the pre-release version’s contents, what it does, how it does it, how well it does it or about future updates, patches or subsequent versions: you must accept it ‘as is’.
3. ACCESSING THE YYG PLATFORMS
3.1. Access Requirements. In order to access certain YYG Platforms and obtain access to certain Publisher Property, you may need to open a YYG Platforms account, have an appropriate level of GameMaker license (which will be notified to you in relation to appropriate YYG Platforms) and be in good standing with YoYo Games. We may also implement verification and Digital Rights Management technology if we consider it necessary. You will need an Internet connection in order to access YYG Platforms and Publisher Property. System requirements for YYG Platforms and (where available) for Publisher Property will be provided on the applicable YYG website.
3.2. Use of YYG Platforms and Publisher Property. You are granted a revocable, limited, worldwide and royalty-free license to use the YYG Platforms for authorised purposes, including to browse, locate, access and use Publisher Property for use with YYG Platforms. Some Publisher Property may be created by YoYo Games and others may be created by third party Publishers. Some may be made available to you for free while others may be licensed for money. You must access the YYG Platforms solely through authorised means (e.g. via GameMaker or via our websites or other methods we may roll out over time) and must not attempt to access the YYG Platforms through any other means, in particular not through automated means like scripts or crawlers or similar technology.
3.3. Other Uses of Publisher Property. IF you hold the appropriate level of GameMaker licence, you may export your content to third party platforms such as iOS and Ubuntu as permitted by us (further details can be found at https://www.yoyogames.com/gamemaker). In no circumstances are you permitted to, at the request of a third party, export that third party’s content. Nor can you request a third party who holds an appropriate level of GameMaker license to carry out such activities on your behalf.
3.4. Responsibility for Publisher Property. Publishers are responsible for how their Publisher Property is displayed and marketed via the YYG Platforms. We take no responsibility or liability for Publisher Property or how they are displayed or marketed, what they do or do not contain or how they perform. All such issues should be addressed further in the relevant EULA (which will be either the YoYo Games Platforms Default Publisher EULA or the relevant publisher’s own EULA, depending on which the relevant Publisher has chosen to apply) and in any event are a matter for you and the Publisher.
3.5. Your Responsibility. You are solely responsible for your own use of the YYG Platforms and for any breach of your obligations under this User Agreement.
3.6. Updates. From time to time, the YYG Platforms or Publisher Property which is software (“**Publisher Software**”) may be subject to updates (such as bug fixes, patches, new versions and enhancements). You can set in GameMaker whether to download updates to Publisher Software automatically or manually. Please note we may remove any Publisher Property which no longer works with the YYG Platforms from the YYG Platforms. YoYo Games may at its sole discretion and from time to time change, add or remove features and functionality of the YYG Platforms without any notice to you. YoYo Games reserves the right to discontinue some or all of the features of the YYG Platforms at any time at its sole discretion (including the provision of software updates). You acknowledge and agree that YoYo Games will not be liable to you or to any third party for any modification, suspension or discontinuance of the YYG Platforms. If you are dissatisfied with any changes to the YYG Platforms, then your sole option is to discontinue or terminate your use of the YYG Platforms as described herein.
3.7. Provision of Information. In order to access the YYG Platforms fully, you may be asked to provide accurate information about yourself such as your name, address and billing details. Any personal information provided to us about you will be held and processed by us under the terms of our [Privacy Policy](https://www.yoyogames.com/legal/privacy), which is hereby incorporated by reference.
3.8. Payments. For YYG Platforms and for Publisher Property which is made available via the YYG Platforms for money, you can use PayPal and potentially other payment methods that we may change, add or remove over time. You agree to pay all applicable amounts that are charged through the YYG Platforms, and that YoYo Games may charge your selected payment method for such amounts. Your use of any payment services will be subject to the terms and conditions of the relevant payment processor. In addition, purchases may include sales tax, including value added tax (VAT) or regional equivalent if applicable in your country. In order to assess the correct level of VAT you need to pay, we will need to collect information about your country of residence (this is further described in our Privacy Policy). Please make sure you give us accurate information about your country of residence, since if we cannot corroborate your country of residence we will be obliged to charge you the highest level of applicable VAT.
3.9. Compliance. You are responsible for compliance with all local laws, regulation and industry practice when accessing and using the YYG Platforms and any Publisher Property.
3.10. Ratings. You may be able to rate and review applicable Publisher Property via the YYG Platforms. Please be honest and constructive in your ratings and bear in mind that you are responsible for your rating and any comments you make about the Publisher Property.

You agree to pay all monies owing to any person as a result of posting your Customer Content on the YYG Platforms.
By posting Customer Content to or through the YYG Platforms, you waive any rights to prior inspection or approval of any marketing or promotional materials related to such Customer Content. You also waive any and all rights of privacy, publicity or any other rights of a similar nature in connection with your Customer Content, or any portion thereof.

If for any reason Publisher Property that you have validly licensed is taken down from the YYG Platforms, we encourage Publishers to notify you and ensure that the relevant Publisher Property will remain available to valid existing Customers for a period of 30 days (but subject to our ultimate discretion and legal obligations as to whether they can be made available in this way or not). Following that period, the Publisher Property (and/or if appropriate the relevant YYG Platforms) will no longer be available unless we notify you otherwise.

6.5. Force Majeure. Neither party shall be liable for any failure to fulfil its obligations under this User Agreement as a result of force majeure and in such circumstances the time for performance shall be extended by a period equivalent to the period during which performance of the obligation has been delayed or failed to be performed.

7.1. Limitation of Liability. The maximum and total aggregate liability of us (YoYo Games), our group of companies, our employees and our affiliates (“YoYo Group”) to you in connection with this User Agreement shall be an amount equal to the net revenue actually received from you (if any) during the preceding calendar year in which the relevant issues occurred. IN NO EVENT WILL YOYO GROUP BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS, CHARGES OR EXPENSES, LOSS OF DATA OR ANY CORRUPTION OR LOSS OF INFORMATION, OR ANY LOSS OF BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY, OR ANY SPECIAL, INDIRECT, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY OR CONSEQUENTIAL LOSS OR DAMAGE OR DISRUPTION OF ANY KIND, IN ANY CASE, WHETHER BASED ON BREACH OF CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR BREACH OF STATUTORY DUTY), MISREPRESENTATION, RESTITUTION OR OTHERWISE WHETHER OR NOT THE RELEVANT PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE. THE FOREGOING LIMITATIONS WILL SURVIVE AND APPLY EVEN IF ANY LIMITED REMEDY SPECIFIED IN THIS USER AGREEMENT IS FOUND TO HAVE FAILED OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.

In addition, we do not warrant or represent that your use of the YYG Platforms will be uninterrupted or secure or free from bugs or errors. Your use of the YYG Platforms and any assets, information or other material obtained via them is at your own discretion and risk. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this Agreement limits, excludes or modifies the statutory consumer guarantees or any other implied warranties provided by applicable law.

9. NOTICE AND PROCEDURE FOR MAKING CLAIMS OF COPYRIGHT OR OTHER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY INFRINGEMENTS
9.1. Respect of Third Party Rights. YoYo Games respects the intellectual property of others and takes the protection of intellectual property very seriously, and we ask our Customers to do the same. Infringing activity will not be tolerated on or through the YYG Platforms.
9.2. Repeat Infringer Policy. YoYo Games’s intellectual property policy is to (i) remove or disable access to material that YoYo Games believes in good faith or upon notice from an intellectual property owner or his or her agent, is infringing the intellectual property of a third party by being made available through the YYG Platforms; and (ii) remove any Customer Content or Feedback uploaded to the YYG Platforms by “repeat infringers.” YoYo Games considers a “repeat infringer” to be any Customer that has uploaded Customer Content or Feedback to or through the YYG Platform and for whom YoYo Games has received more than two takedown notices compliant with the provisions of 17 U.S.C. § 512 with respect to such content. YoYo Games has discretion, however, to terminate the account of any Customer after receipt of a single Notification of Claimed Infringement (as defined below) or upon YoYo Games’s own determination.
9.3. Procedure for Reporting Claimed Infringement. If you believe that any Customer Content made available on or through the YYG Platforms has been used or exploited in a manner that infringes an intellectual property right you own or control, then please promptly send a “Notification of Claimed Infringement” containing the following information to the Designated Agent identified below. Your Notification of Claimed Infringement may be shared by YoYo Games with the Customer alleged to have infringed a right you own or control, and you hereby consent to YoYo Games making such disclosure. Your communication must include substantially the following:
A physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of the work(s) that has/have been allegedly infringed;
Identification of works or materials being infringed, or, if multiple works are covered by a single notification, then a representative list of such works;
Identification of the specific material that is claimed to be infringing or to be the subject of infringing activity and that is to be removed or access to which is to be disabled, and information reasonably sufficient to permit YoYo Games to locate the material;
Information reasonably sufficient to permit YoYo Games to contact you, such as an address, telephone number and, if available, an electronic mail address at which you may be contacted;
A statement that you have a good faith belief that the use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent or the law; and
A statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that you are authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.
You should consult with your own lawyer and/or see 17 U.S.C. § 512 to confirm your obligations to provide a valid notice of claimed infringement.
9.4. Designated Agent Contact Information. YoYo Games’s designated agent for receipt of Notifications of Claimed Infringement (the “Designated Agent”) can be contacted at:
Via Ticket: https://help.yoyogames.com
Via U.S. Mail: Helpdesk Team, YoYo Games Ltd, River Court, 5 West Victoria Dock Road, Dundee, UK DD1 3JT
9.5. Counter Notification. If you receive a notification from YoYo Games that material made available by you on or through the YYG Platforms has been the subject of a Notification of Claimed Infringement, then you will have the right to provide YoYo Games with what is called a “Counter Notification.” To be effective, a Counter Notification must be in writing, provided to YoYo Games’s Designated Agent through one of the methods identified in Section 9.4 and include substantially the following information:
A physical or electronic signature of the subscriber;
Identification of the material that has been removed or to which access has been disabled and the location at which the material appeared before it was removed or access to it was disabled;
A statement under penalty of perjury that the subscriber has a good faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled; and
The subscriber’s name, address and telephone number, and a statement that the subscriber consents to the jurisdiction of Federal District Court for the judicial district in which the address is located, or if the subscriber’s address is outside of the United States, then for any judicial district in which YoYo Games may be found, and that the subscriber will accept service of process from the person who provided notification under Section 9.4 above or an agent of such person.
9.6. A party submitting a Counter Notification should consult a lawyer or see 17 U.S.C. § 512 to confirm the party’s obligations to provide a valid counter notification under the Copyright Act.
9.7. Reposting of Content Subject to a Counter Notification. If you submit a Counter Notification to YoYo Games in response to a Notification of Claimed Infringement, then YoYo Games will promptly provide the person who provided the Notification of Claimed Infringement with a copy of your Counter Notification and inform that person that YoYo Games will replace the removed content or cease disabling access to it in 10 business days, and YoYo Games will replace the removed content and cease disabling access to it not less than 10, nor more than 14, business days following receipt of the Counter Notification, unless YoYo Games’s Designated Agent receives notice from the party that submitted the Notification of Claimed Infringement that such person has filed an action seeking a court order to restrain the Customer from engaging in infringing activity relating to the material on YoYo Games’s system or network.
9.8. False Notifications of Claimed Infringement or Counter Notifications. The Copyright Act provides that:
[a]ny person who knowingly materially misrepresents under [Section 512 of the Copyright Act (17 U.S.C. § 512)] (1) that material or activity is infringing, or (2) that material or activity was removed or disabled by mistake or misidentification, will be liable for any damages, including costs and attorneys’ fees, incurred by the alleged infringer, by any copyright owner or copyright owner’s authorized licensee, or by a service provider, who is injured by such misrepresentation, as the result of [YoYo Games] relying upon such misrepresentation in removing or disabling access to the material or activity claimed to be infringing, or in replacing the removed material or ceasing to disable access to it.
17 U.S.C. § 512(f).
9.9. YoYo Games reserves the right to seek damages from any party that submits a Notification of Claimed Infringement or Counter Notification in violation of the law.
10. GENERAL
(i) Each party will keep any confidential information of the other party confidential and secure and will not disclose or communicate it to any third party, except its professional representatives or advisers or as required by law.
