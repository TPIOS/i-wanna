				<h1>HTML5</h1>
				<p>There is a special <i>JavaScript</i> variable that can be used on those rare occasions when the contents of the html5game folder are stored in a completely different URL. Normally this path is hard-coded in 
				the JavaScript file and is relative to the location from where the JavaScript is called, but you can set the variable <tt>g_GameMakerHTML5Dir</tt> before the call to the game script and the game will be run 
				from the newly defined location.</p>
