				<h1>Events</h1>
				<p>
				The <b>Destroy</b> event is triggered the moment that the code or D'n'D action is called, with any code in the event being run before the rest of the code that triggered the event is called. So, if you 
				call instance_destroy() from one instance, this will trigger the destroy event and run any code it contains in the target instance, and then the original instance that called the function would continue to the 
				end of its code block.
