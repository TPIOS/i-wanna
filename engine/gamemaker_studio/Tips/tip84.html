				<h1>Events</h1>
				<p>
				You have 16 <b>user</b> events that you can use to help organise your game objects better. These are particularly useful when used in conjunction with "Parents" as they permit you to apply specific 
				behaviours to an instance with inherited events. User events are triggered from code and will be run when triggered (much like scripts) before the original code-block continues.
