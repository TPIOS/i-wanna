				<h1>Events</h1>
				<p>
				You can use the <b>Pre</b> and <b>Post</b> draw and draw GUI events to "layer" elements in your game. For example, you could have all instances drawing shadows in the pre-draw event and then 
				have the standard draw drawing their sprites. This would ensure that the shadows are always drawn before anything else, since the pre-draw event is run for all instances before the standard draw event 
				is run for all instances.
