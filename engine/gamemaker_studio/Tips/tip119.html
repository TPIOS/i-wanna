				<h1>Compiler Cache</h1>
				<p>
				If you get any "odd" issues in your games, like instances suddenly have the wrong sprite, or a function is flagged as incorrect when you can clearly see that it's fine, you should <i>always</i> 
				clear the compiler cache and run again. The cache can become "stale" over time and cause some strange issues, especially on the YYC targets and the HTML5 module. You can clear the cache by 
				clicking the green "broom" icon at the top of the IDE (beside the play buttons).
