				<h1>Events</h1>
				<p>
				<b>Standard</b> draw events (Draw Begin, Draw and Draw End) are triggered once per view, so if you have multiple views the events will be triggered for each of them. Consider checking which 
				view is currently being drawn (using <a href="http://docs.yoyogames.com/source/dadiospice/002_reference/windows%20and%20views/views/view_current.html"><tt>view_current</tt></a>) and 
				limit what is drawn to only those views that are required.
