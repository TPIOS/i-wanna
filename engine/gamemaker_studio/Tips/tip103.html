				<h1>Scripts</h1>
				<p>
				You can create sub-scripts within a single script by clicking one of the empty tabs at the top of the Script Editor. These sub-scripts are exactly the same as a regular script only 
				they are stored within the parent script window, rather than on the resource tree. Very handy for scripts that you only ever call from within other scripts and for keeping your resource 
				tree tidy.
