				<h1>Room Editor</h1>
				<p>
				If you are working with multiple tile layers, you have the option to only show the current layer being worked on in the room editor. By ticking and un-ticking the option "hide other layers" you can 
				toggle between the current layer and all layers being visible, making it easier to work with multiple tilesets and depths.
