				<h1>Android</h1>
				You can bypass the 50MB upload limit on your Google Play submitted games by creating your final <b>APK</b> with an 
				<a href="http://docs.yoyogames.com/source/dadiospice/001_advanced%20use/global%20game%20settings/licensing%20tab.html"><i>expansion file</i></a>. An <i>APK Expansion</i> splits your final 
				game into two parts, the <tt>*.apk</tt> and the expansion <tt>*.zip</tt>, with all the game assets placed in the separate expansion file in order to reduce the overall size of the initial <tt>*.apk</tt> 
				package. When the user installs your game and runs it for the first time, this expansion file is downloaded and installed on their device.</p>
