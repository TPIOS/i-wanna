				If you disable "<i>Clear Background With Window Colour</i>" and "<i>Clear Display Buffer With Window Colour</i>" in the views tab, as well as disable the option "<i>Draw Background Colour</i>" 
				in the backgrounds tab, you can get a boost in performance. However you may get odd graphical effects if you don't have a background image, if your view goes out the room, or you have multiple view ports.
