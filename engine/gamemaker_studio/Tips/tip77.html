				<h1>Events</h1>
				<p>
				If you have multiple objects with the same block of code in the same event, you should consider using a <b>Parent</b> object. Creating a parent with this event and code, means that its children 
				will "inherit" the event, making modifying code easier as a change to the parent code block will affect all the "child" objects too. Note that if the "child" object needs specific code in the same event, 
				you should call <a href="http://docs.yoyogames.com/source/dadiospice/002_reference/objects%20and%20instances/objects/generating%20events/event_inherited.html"><tt>event_inherited()</tt></a> 
				first to call the parent code-block.
