				<h1>Events</h1>
				<p>
				The <b>Pre Draw</b> event occurs before any other drawing occurs, and any draw codes in this event will draw directly to the <i>back buffer</i>, ignoring views and GUI resolutions. However, if you have 
				checked "Clear background with window colour" in the Views tab or "Draw background colour" in the Backgrounds tab of the Room Editor, you will not see anything as those options clear the back buffer with 
				the window colour before drawing.
