				<h1>Events</h1>
				<p>
				You can get easily apply post draw effects to the full draw canvas by using the <b>Post Draw</b> event. This event is triggered after all other draw events, and is the ideal place to add fullscreen 
				shader effects, surface effects, fades, etc... as it is over everything else and is not affected by views or the size of the GUI.
